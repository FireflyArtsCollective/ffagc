# It's not worth creating a bunch of db schema info for this data which is only
# used to generate informational text.
# DO NOT let this yaml become a dumping ground for things that should be in
# the db (famous last words).  Rule of thumb: If you need to know the value
# behind the formatted text, don't put it here.

# note, the keys here are the downcase of the grant name
