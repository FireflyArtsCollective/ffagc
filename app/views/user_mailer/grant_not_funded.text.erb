<%= @artist.name %>,

Thank you for taking the time and effort to pull together a proposal for the <%= @year %> Firefly <%= @grant.name %> Grant. We regret to inform you that your project was not chosen to receive funding.

Competition this year was unprecedented! Careful and tough decisions had to be made by the committee, and we hope you are not discouraged by this news.

Please don’t let lack of funding from this source stop you from bringing your vision to the woods, or from applying for a grant next year. If you would like specific feedback on your project regarding this funding decision, please let us know and we’ll get back to you as soon as possible.
